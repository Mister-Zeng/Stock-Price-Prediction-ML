# Stock-Price-Prediction-ML

Welcome to the Stock Price Prediction App, a machine learning model for predicting stock prices. This application uses Jupyter Notebook and Python to demonstrate how to predict stock prices based on historical data.

## Prerequisites

Before running the app, ensure that you have Python installed on your machine. You can download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

## Setup

To run the app, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository to your local machine:**

`git clone https://github.com/Mister-Zeng/Stock-Price-Prediction-ML.git`

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**

`cd stock-price-prediction`

3. **Create a virtual environment at the root directory:**

`python -m venv virt`

4. **Activate the virtual environment:**

`source virt/bin/activate`

5. **Install JupyterLab and required dependencies:**


`pip install jupyterlab notebook`

6. **Start Jupyter Notebook:**

`jupyter notebook`

## Running the App

1. Open the "Stock Price Prediction.ipynb" file in Jupyter Notebook and run each cell by pressing Shift + Enter.
2. After running all the cells, you will see stock selection and date selection widgets at button.
3. Once the widgets are displayed, select the stock and date for which you want to get the predicted price.
4. Click the "Get Predicted Price" button.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues or the widgets do not appear, try the following:

- Restart the Jupyter Notebook kernel: Click on the "Kernel" menu and select "Restart Kernel."
- Restart the virtual environment: Deactivate the virtual environment (\`deactivate\`) and activate it again (\`source virt/bin/activate\`).
- Ensure all dependencies are installed: Check that you have installed all the required dependencies mentioned in the project.
